# Mikrotik-Ansible Repository

## Overview

Welcome to the Mikrotik-Ansible repository! This repository serves as a collection of Ansible playbooks, roles, and scripts for configuring Mikrotik devices. Whether you're managing a small network or a large-scale infrastructure, Ansible offers powerful automation capabilities to streamline the management and configuration of Mikrotik routers and switches.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a centralized location for storing and sharing Ansible resources tailored specifically for Mikrotik devices. By leveraging Ansible's infrastructure as code approach, network administrators and engineers can automate routine tasks, enforce consistent configurations, and deploy changes across their Mikrotik network efficiently and reliably.

## Contents

This repository contains a variety of Ansible resources, including:

- **Playbooks:** Pre-written sequences of tasks to automate specific configuration tasks or workflows on Mikrotik devices.
- **Roles:** Reusable collections of Ansible tasks, handlers, templates, and variables that encapsulate specific configuration roles (e.g., DHCP server, firewall rules) for Mikrotik devices.
- **Scripts:** Custom scripts or modules to extend Ansible's capabilities for interacting with Mikrotik devices, such as retrieving device information, performing backups, or executing complex tasks.
